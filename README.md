HiðŸ‘‹! Welcome to my very first cli data projectðŸŽ‰! In this directory, this app provides a CLI to access the data of 20 pokemons fetched from an Pokemon api. It also auto saves the Pokemon the user has just viewed and allows the user to view all the items he or she has learned about. 

## Installation & Usage
$ bundle install

In the directory, simply type the below and follow the on screen prompts.

$ ruby bin/run
